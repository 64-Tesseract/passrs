# passrs ~ Terminal Password Manager & Authenticator
A TUI (terminal "GUI") password and 2FA code manager, essentially a direct upgrade from [my C terminal authenticator](https://github.com/64-Tesseract/ncAuth).

~~**Important note:** You need to install Xorg libraries (`xorg-devel`, `libxcb-devel`) for *passrs* to compile the clipboard module.~~  
**More important note:** I got rid of the clipboard library, no need for extra dependencies now

## Features
- Scriptability with command-line arguments and environment variables
- `Option<Encryption>` using a 32-byte master password (shorter passwords are padded with `\0`s, longer ones are clipped)
- Vim-ish keybindings
- Copy password or 2FA token to clipboard, you can also get the next 2FA token if you're a slow alt-tabber
- Unicode auto-password generation (what hacker would even *try* to guess `Òóó∑ÙÄõøíîΩ¥ïôÚëëåÛöñµÒ™£ºÚß©ÆÛüõ¢Úéà¢ÙÑ™†Òáª≤Û∂ΩΩÒÑíÄÒøïóÒ©ùó`?)  
  ~~yeah ok but what website would even *try* support it? like it doesn't even have a single uppercase letter or special symbol~~
- Passwords show you how to type each non-standard character using ctrl-shift-U (in edit mode, move the cursor along each character)
- 40x more bloated than the C version lesgoooo

## Usage
I won't go over every detail, since `passrs --help` should tell you all you need. But for a quick rundown:

- Specify a different data file with `--file FILE` to securely store different sets of passwords, 2FA codes, and your colour theme (arguably the most important bit)  
  Defaults to `~/.local/share/passrs`, in protest of cluttered home folders
- Switch between 2FA codes and passwords with `Tab`, navigate with arrow/Vim keys
- Press `o` to create a new password or 2FA code, or `e` on an existing one to edit it  
  (You can only navigate with arrow keys in edit mode, Vim keys would type into text fields ~~Idea: use the main keyboard for typing, have a separate keyboard solely for Vim navigation~~)
- Press `Enter` to save the edited item or `Esc` to cancel editing it, then `Esc` or `q` to quit the main GUI and save

## FAQ
~~Each question was asked exactly zero (0) times, but with my social life I consider that frequent~~

- **What does this thing run on?**  
  Anything that compiles Rust and that all the libraries support, which should also be anything that compiles Rust.
- **How secure are the encrypted passwords/2FA codes?**  
  I wouldn't bet much on the security if glowies got their hands on it, but it should be enough to stop the average Kali "hacker". Refer to [some "onion" library I use](https://docs.rs/orion/0.15.5/orion/index.html) for actual details.
- **Do Unicode passwords even work in websites? How are weird characters handled by server software?**  
  After using `passrs` personally, I can say that the vast majority don't support much besides ASCII - Steam seems to be the worst offender.  
  Some websites partially support Unicode, but give vague errors - usually, there's too many bytes in the password, so trimming it down by half seems to do the trick.  
  Revolt, being a fellow Rust-based app, supports long Unicode passwords just fine :gigachad:
- **How about clipboard for Wayland?**  
  In *ncAuth*, I simply called the user's shell script to copy stuff to any WM's clipboard, and in the previous version of *passrs* I used a native library to set the clipboard instead. It was a bit dodgy though, singe it needed a couple external dependencies and the text was cleared when you closed *passrs* (?!)... Now though, it just runs a command from the env variable `PASSRS_COPY`, so you don't need to write long shell scripts but don't need external libraries either!
  Also, I've made sure to include a commandline interface to *passrs*, so if you like you can write a shell script to select and copy passwords/2FA codes using something like `dmenu`. This might be useful for SXMO, if you only want to use native dialogs - see [`sxmo_passrs.sh`](sxmo_passrs.sh) for an example script.
- **How about Windows?**  
  ‚Äç
- **No license?**  
  No licence, go ham. If anyone insists that "intellectual property" isn't a completely delusional concept, then I claim `1` and `0` as my own.  
  Also don't open the `NO-LICENCE` file, that's just to keep Cargo happy.
